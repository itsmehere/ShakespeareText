Example:

Profitless usurer why dost thou spend, Upon thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thy self in your decay With means more blessed than my thoughts canst move, And I am still with me, For thou not renewest, Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.

Gentle thou art, Within the gentle closure of my love, yea take them all, What hast thou then more than thou art?

O none but unthrifts, dear my love thou usest, But yet be blamed, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, The world will be the praise.

Be not self-willed for thou art old, And see thy blood warm when thou art not, though I feel thou art, and therefore to be won, Beauteous thou art, If ten of thine ten times happy me.

Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am old, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
